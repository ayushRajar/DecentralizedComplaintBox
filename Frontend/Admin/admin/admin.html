                <h3>Frequent Power Outages in the Student Dormitories Affecting Study and Daily Activities</h3>

                    As a resident of the student dormitories at XYZ College, I am experiencing frequent power outages that significantly disrupt my daily routine and academic activities. These outages occur multiple times a week, often lasting for several hours. The lack of consistent electricity makes it challenging to complete assignments, study for exams, and even perform basic tasks such as charging electronic devices. Additionally, it raises safety concerns, especially during the evening and nighttime. I urge the administration to investigate and address this issue promptly, ensuring a reliable power supply to support students' academic success and well-being.
