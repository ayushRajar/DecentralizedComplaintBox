                <h3>Details</h3>
                <textarea readonly>As a student at XYZ College, I am concerned about the lack of a CCTV camera in Classroom 519. The presence of CCTV cameras in classrooms is essential for ensuring the safety and security of students and faculty members. Classroom 519, where I have several important lectures and group study sessions, currently does not have a CCTV camera installed. This absence raises concerns about the security of personal belongings and the overall safety within the classroom. Additionally, CCTV cameras play a crucial role in monitoring and maintaining discipline. I kindly request the administration to install a CCTV camera in Classroom 519 to enhance the safety measures and ensure a secure learning environment for all students and staff.</textarea>
